        <p>
          We are JAM, a dedicated team of three developers committed to
          advancing our expertise in both front-end and back-end web
          development. This website was built as part of our ongoing journey to
          strengthen our programming skills and gain hands-on experience with
          modern technologies.
          <p>
            Our primary focus has been on learning and applying JavaScript and
            React, while also exploring a broad range of additional tools,
            libraries, and programming languages essential for full-stack
            development. By building this project from the ground up, we’ve had
            the opportunity to deepen our understanding of responsive design
            principles, user experience best practices, and efficient coding
            techniques.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond the technical skills, this project has also allowed us to
            improve our collaboration, project management, and problem-solving
            skills that are just as critical in the development process. We view
            this website not only as a demonstration of what we’ve learned so
            far, but also as a foundation for continued growth as software
            developers.

            Hello! Computer science major at James Madison University, I have always had an interest about how things could be created and optimized so well, just with lines of code.
          </p>

          <p> 
            This is the first project I have worked on with a team, using React and Node.js.  
            <br />
            Having to work on front end for the first time was definitely something I enjoyed, seeing how the website was taking life as I was coding it.
            <br />
          </p>

          <p> 
          I cannot wait to see how far we can take this project, since it already gave me the inspiration to make more developing projects.
