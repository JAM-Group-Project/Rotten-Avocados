# Rotten-Avocados ü•ë
Group project inspired by Rotten Tomatoes üçÖ, made to browse movies from the TMDB API Database to rate them, write a note and add them to categories and lists. 
It consists of pulling data provided by The Movie Database, using different language: 
- **Front end:**
    - React
    - TailwindCSS
- **Back end:**
    - node.js ( for Java script full-stack )
    - FastAPI
- **Database** ( Movies, ‚ÄúUsers‚Äù, Lists, Ratings): 
    - PostgreSQL, IMDB API 

# First template üöó
This was our first idea of what the website should look like and what should it do.

## Making the website functional
From that point, we decided to have a main page where the user would be able to see the most recent but also top rated movies and shows of the moment.

## An in-time filtering search bar
But of course a crucial part of this website is the search bar, functional and filter movies in real time within each character typed

## Making the website enjoyable
We wanted the user to feel comfortable using the website which included having some nice asthetique of each movie card, a intuitive font for the rating but also the hover function as well as a multiple page movie/shows.
