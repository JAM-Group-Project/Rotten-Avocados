# Rotten-Avocado 🥑
Group project inspired by Rotten Tomatoes 🍅, made to browse movies from the TMDB API Database to rate them, write a note and add them to categories and lists. 
It consists of pulling data provided by The Movie Database, using different language: 
- **Front end:**
    - React
    - TailwindCSS
- **Back end:**
    - node.js ( for Java script full-stack ) + Express
    - FastAPI
- **Database** ( Movies, “Users”, Lists, Ratings): 
    - PostgreSQL
