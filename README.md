# First template 🚗
This was our first idea of what the website should look like and what should it do.

## Making the website functional
From that point, we decided to have a main page where the user would be able to see the most recent but also top rated movies and shows of the moment.

## An in-time filtering search bar
But of course a crucial part of this website is the search bar, functional and filter movies in real time within each character typed

## Making the website enjoyable
We wanted the user to feel comfortable using the website which included having some nice asthetique of each movie card, a intuitive font for the rating but also the hover function as well as a multiple page movie/shows.

It is crucial for the website to be smooth, including a hover animation for the movie/shows card or a comfortable font with different colors.

## A favorite tab for convenience
The user has to be able to bookmark any findings he can make, going through that favorite list to gain an existential amount of time
