# Rotten-Avocados 🥑
Group project inspired by Rotten Tomatoes 🍅, made to browse movies from the TMDB API Database to rate them, write a note and add them to categories and lists. 
It consists of pulling data provided by The Movie Database, using different language: 
- **Front end:**
    - React
    - TailwindCSS
- **Back end:**
    - node.js ( for Java script full-stack ) + Express
    - FastAPI
- **Database** ( Movies, “Users”, Lists, Ratings): 
    - PostgreSQL

# First template 🚗
This was our first idea of what the website should look like and what should it do.

From that point, we decided to have a main page where the user would be able to see the most recent but also top rated movies and shows of the moment.
